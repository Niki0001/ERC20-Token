# TASK DESCRIPTION
## WHAT I DO IN THIS TASK :-Create and Deploy an ERC20 Token
#### I need a Web3 Wallet =Metamask ,Test ETH,A modern browser e.g.Chrome.
## What is an ERC20 token?
#### ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the proposal identifier number. ERC-20 was designed to improve the Ethereum network.ERC-20 is one of the most significant ERCs. It has emerged as the technical standard for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network, used for token implementation. ERC-20 contains a set of rules that all Ethereum based tokens must follow.
## Key Points about ERC-20 Tokens:
#### Standardized Functions: ERC-20 tokens follow a specific set of standards, which means they have a common list of rules and functions. This includes how the tokens can be transferred, how transactions are approved, how users can access data about a token, and the total supply of tokens.
#### Transferability and Exchange: These tokens can be transferred from one account to another as payment, similar to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and can be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.
#### ERC-20 is a standard or guideline for creating new tokens. The standard defines six mandatory functions that a smart contract should implement and three optional ones.
#### The mandatory functions are listed below with explanations.
#### totalSupply: A method that defines the total supply of your tokens; when this limit is reached, the smart contract will refuse to create new tokens.
#### balanceOf: A method that returns the number of tokens a wallet address has.
#### transfer: A method that takes a certain amount of tokens from the total supply and gives it to a user.
#### transferFrom: Another type of transfer method that is used to transfer tokens between users.
#### approve: This method verifies whether a smart contract is allowed to allocate a certain amount of tokens to a user, considering the total supply.
#### allowance: This method is exactly the same as the approved method except that it checks if one user has enough balance to send a certain amount of tokens to another
# Creating Our Own Token:
## Getting Test ETH :
#### To begin deploying our contract on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, we need to install the MetaMask browser extension. Once our wallet is set up,we need to acquire some test ETH.
#### I get faucets for Sepolia network for testing deployment on test network from [Link Text](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet)
